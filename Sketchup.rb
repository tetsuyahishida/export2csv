# This file defines a number of useful utilities that are used by other
# Ruby scripts.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These functions are used to help with adding new menu items from a
# script.  The function file_loaded? is used to tell if the file
# has already been loaded.  If it returns true, then you should not
# add new menu items.  It is useful to allow you to reload a file
# while you are testing it without having to restart SketchUp and without
# Having it add new menu items every time it is loaded.

# This array keeps track of loaded files.  It is like the Ruby variable $"
# that is set by require, but it is not set automatically.  You have
# to call file_loaded to add a filename to the array
$loaded_files = []

# Call this method to see if a file is already loaded.
def file_loaded?(filename)
    $loaded_files.include? filename
end

# Call this function at the end of a file that you are loading to
# let the system know that you have loaded it.
def file_loaded(filename)
    $loaded_files.push(filename) if not $loaded_files.include?(filename)
end

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This function will add a separator to a given menu the first
# time it is called.  It is useful for adding a separator before
# the first plugin that is added to a given menu
$menu_separator_list = []

        $menu_separator_list.push menuname
    end
end

# This is a wrapper for UI.inputbox.  You call it exactly the same
# as UI.inputbox.  UI.inputbox will raise an exception if it can't
# convert the string entered for one of the values into the right type.
# This method will trap the exception and display an error dialog and
# then prompt for the values again.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default, SketchUp automatically loads (using require) all files with
# the .rb extension in the plugins directory.  This function can be used
# to automatically load all .rb files from a different directory also.  to
# use this add a call like the following to a file in the plugins directory
# require_all "MyRubyScripts"
def require_all(dirname)
    begin
        rbfiles = Dir[File.join(dirname, "*.rb")]
        $:.push dirname
